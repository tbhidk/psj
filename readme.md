## running the program
i assume you are using linux. i use Ubuntu 20.04.
1. clone this repo
2. open terminal
3. compile the c program using `gcc`:  
   `gcc TCPEchoClient.c -o tcpcli`
4. run the program
5. what else? it's done.

have any errors? just google it, i'm pretty sure you would find it.

for the sake of simplicity, the additional board link is added so it could be qwikly copy-pasted
